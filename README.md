## Description
This application allows users to post about and read posts from other developers about anything they wish to talk about tech realted. This can be anywhere from newest technoligies, to questions they could have or solutions to problems others might face. 

My motivation for building this app was to help me and other up and coming devolpers who could use an easy way to see what is new and being talked aboiut in the tech field. Everything is always new and changing, so having a blog where people can stay current on things is a great way to stay in the loop.
